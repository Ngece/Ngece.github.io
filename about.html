        <h4><b>About the Project</b></h4>
        <p>

Welcome to School Planet, a project that holds a special place in my heart. Before I dive into the details, let me take a moment to share the story of what inspired this project and how it came to life.

As a student at ALX Africa, I've always been passionate about learning and exploring new horizons. Throughout my journey, I've encountered various challenges and triumphs that have shaped my growth as a developer. It was during this time that the idea for School Planet 
was to be put into action.

The project originated from a burning desire to create something meaningful and impactful, beyond the confines of the classroom. It wasn't just about fulfilling a project requirement; it was about translating my vision into a tangible reality that could benefit others.

The timeline of this project is intertwined with my ALX experience. It represents the culmination of countless hours spent learning, practicing, and pushing my boundaries. I chose to take the time to build this project ffor my portfolio as it has always bee an idea to me, every step has been a testament to my dedication and perseverance.

School Planet is not only a personal endeavor but also it serves as a showcase of the skills, knowledge, and passion I've developed during my time here. I'm immensely grateful for the guidance and support I've received from the ALX/Holberton community.

To explore the project, feel free to visit the School Planet Portfolio Project page on my Github: <a href="https://github.com/Ngece/Ngece.github.io">See project</a>. There, you'll find additional information and resources related to this endeavor.

<h1>Thank you for joining me on this journey !!!</h1>
